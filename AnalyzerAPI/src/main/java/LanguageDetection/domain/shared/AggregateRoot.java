/**
 * An aggregate root is a Domain-Driven Design pattern for defining scopes of
 * change and "whole-objects". Some entities cluster other objects (entities and
 * value objects) which don't make sense to exist outside of that entity (e.g.,
 * OrderLine and Order).
 * <p>
 * The aggregate root is the entity serving as a root for that cluster of
 * objects. these are the only objects that client code can interact directly
 * and that is managed by Repositories. "inside" objects cannot be directly
 * manipulated by client code, instead they need to be manipulated thru the
 * aggregate root.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typical examples are:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Order {OrderLine, Billing Address, Shipping Address}
 * <li>Customer {Home Address}
 * <li>Product
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * Quoting
 * <a href="https://domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DDD_Reference_2015-03.pdf">Eric
 * Evans</a>:
 * <blockquote>
 * Cluster the entities and value objects into aggregates and define boundaries around each.
 * Choose one entity to be the root of each aggregate, and allow external objects to hold
 * references to the root only (references to internal members passed out for use within a
 * single operation only). Define properties and invariants for the aggregate as a whole and
 * give enforcement responsibility to the root or some designated framework mechanism.
 * <br>
 * Use the same aggregate boundaries to govern transactions and distribution.
 * Within an aggregate boundary, apply consistency rules synchronously. Across boundaries,
 * handle updates asynchronously.
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * <b>Aggregate rules:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The root Entity has global identity, entities inside the boundary have local identity, unique
 * only within the
 * Aggregate.
 * <li>The root Entity can hand references to the internal Entities to other objects, but they can
 * only use them
 * transiently (within a single method or block).
 * <li>Objects within the Aggregate can hold references to other Aggregate roots.
 * <li>Nothing outside the Aggregate boundary can hold a reference to anything inside
 * <li>Only Aggregate Roots can be obtained directly with database queries.Â  Everything else must be
 * done through
 * traversal.
 * <li>A delete operation must remove everything within the Aggregate boundary all at once.
 * <li>When a change to any object within the Aggregate boundary is committed, all invariants of the
 * whole Aggregate
 * must be satisfied.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Aggregates and specialization (inheritance)</b>
 * <p>
 * In the case there is a specialization of domain concepts it is important to not think about
 * implementation
 * inheritance but actual domain specialization. The point is not to reuse code but to capture
 * concepts that are indeed
 * specialization of more abstract concepts.
